# Leave Management Module Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
The Leave Management Module has been successfully implemented for the GOHR HR Management System, providing comprehensive leave request management, approval workflows, and reporting capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Laravel 12)
- **Models**: `Leave`, `LeaveType`, `LeaveBalance`
- **Controllers**: `LeaveController`, `LeaveTypeController`, `LeaveBalanceController`
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API with proper authentication and authorization
- **Database**: MySQL with proper relationships and constraints

### Frontend (Vue.js 3 + Composition API)
- **Views**: Main leave management interface, calendar view, reports, leave types, and leave balances
- **Components**: Modal components for CRUD operations
- **State Management**: Pinia store with comprehensive actions and getters
- **Routing**: Vue Router with role-based access control

## 📊 Database Schema

### Leave Types Table
- `id`, `name`, `description`, `default_days`, `color`, `requires_approval`, `organization_id`
- Supports multiple organizations with unique constraints
- Color coding for visual identification

### Leaves Table
- `id`, `user_id`, `leave_type_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `total_days`, `reason`, `status`
- Status: pending, approved, rejected, cancelled
- Approval tracking with `approved_by` and `approved_at`
- Proper indexing for performance

### Leave Balances Table
- `id`, `user_id`, `leave_type_id`, `year`, `total_days`, `used_days`, `remaining_days`
- Year-based tracking with unique constraints
- Automatic calculation of remaining days
